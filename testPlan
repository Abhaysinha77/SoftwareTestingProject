1. 🎯 Objective
To validate the login functionality of the VWO web application by verifying correct behavior with valid and invalid input data, ensuring secure authentication, proper user redirection, and compliance with usability and security standards.

2. 🔍 Scope
In Scope:
Input validation for email and password fields

UI functionality (buttons, form handling)

Successful and failed login attempts

Error messages and security behavior

Browser compatibility checks (desktop/mobile)

Out of Scope:
Forgot Password functionality

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Post-login dashboard features

Backend service/API testing

3. ✅ Assumptions
Test user accounts (valid/invalid) are already provisioned.

MFA and CAPTCHA are disabled for the purpose of functional testing.

Testing is done on staging or pre-production environment.

Time and session settings are consistent across browsers.

Application uses secure HTTPS connection on all environments.

4. 🧪 Test Strategy
Test Type	Description
Positive Testing	Validate successful login with correct credentials.
Negative Testing	Validate handling of incorrect, blank, or invalid inputs.
UI Validation	Ensure field alignment, placeholders, and button behavior are consistent.
Security Checks	Manual verification of SQL/XSS attempts and login throttling.
Responsive Testing	Confirm layout and behavior across browsers/devices.
Usability Checks	Validate error messages, labels, and accessibility cues.

5. 📋 Key Test Scenarios
ID	Test Case Description	Input	Expected Result
TC01	Login with valid credentials	valid_user@example.com / validPass123	Redirect to dashboard
TC02	Blank email field	"" / validPass123	Show “Email is required”
TC03	Blank password field	valid_user@example.com / ""	Show “Password is required”
TC04	Invalid credentials	wrong_user@example.com / wrongPass	Show generic error message
TC05	Invalid email format	user@com	Show “Enter a valid email”
TC06	Email with leading/trailing spaces	" user@example.com " / validPass123	Trim spaces and login successfully
TC07	Case-insensitive email	USER@example.com / validPass123	Login successful
TC08	SQL Injection attempt	' OR 1=1-- / any	Show generic error, no access
TC09	XSS script in email field	<script>alert(1)</script>	Input sanitized, no script executed
TC10	Multiple failed attempts	5+ incorrect logins	Show lockout message or throttle
TC11	Login on unsupported browser	IE11	Show unsupported browser message or graceful fallback
