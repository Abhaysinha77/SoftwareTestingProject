# 🧪 Manual Testing Project Repository

Welcome to the **Manual Testing Project** repository. This repository serves as a centralized hub for all manual QA documentation, including the master **Test Plan**, detailed **Test Cases**, and structured **testing workflows**. It is intended to support QA engineers, product teams, and stakeholders in ensuring comprehensive test coverage, traceability, and delivery of high-quality software.

---

## 📋 Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Establish a **repeatable and scalable** manual testing process.
- Document test efforts in a structured, industry-standard format.
- Improve **traceability** between requirements and test cases.
- Enable **cross-team collaboration** through accessible and clear documentation.
- Support future transition to automation or integration with test management tools.

This project is especially useful during the **early stages of development**, **prototype validation**, or when **automation is not feasible**.

---

## 🧭 Testing Objectives

- Validate functional requirements of the application under test (AUT).
- Identify and document defects through structured exploratory testing.
- Ensure UI elements meet user experience and accessibility expectations.
- Provide stakeholders with visibility into test coverage and defect status.
- Serve as a QA knowledge base and onboarding guide for new testers.

## 📄 Test Plan Overview

The **Test Plan** is located in the `/TestPlan/` directory and follows industry-standard documentation practices (based on IEEE 829 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3).

### Contents of the Test Plan:
- **Test Objectives & Scope**
- **Testing Strategy (Black-box, Ad-hoc, Regression, etc.)**
- **Test Deliverables**
- **Milestones & Schedule**
- **Roles and Responsibilities**
- **Test Environment Requirements**
- **Tools and Resources**
- **Risk Management and Mitigation**
- **Entry/Exit Criteria**

📄 Example:  
`TestPlan/Test_Plan_v1.0.md`

## ✅ Test Cases

All test cases are located in the `/TestCases/` directory and are organized **module-wise** for easy navigation and maintenance.

### Each Test Case Document Contains:
- Unique **Test Case ID**
- **Title/Description** of the scenario
- **Preconditions** and **Dependencies**
- **Detailed Steps to Execute**
- **Expected Result**
- **Actual Result** (during execution)
- **Pass/Fail Status**
- **Priority/Severity**
- **Linked Requirement/User Story ID**
- **Defect References** (if applicable)

📁 Examples:
- `TestCases/Login_Module_TestCases.xlsx`
- `TestCases/Signup_Module_TestCases.xlsx`
- `TestCases/Profile_Management_TestCases.xlsx`

> Test case files are maintained in `.xlsx` format for structured tracking and easy reporting.
